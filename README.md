Venture to places you never knew existed within your own community.

## Inspiration

When someone asks what to do in Vancouver, the answers usually default to the headline attractions. Great spots, but they leave out the smaller discoveries that make a city feel personal: a tucked-away viewpoint, a quiet pond, a mural on a side street, a pop-up event you only notice by walking past. We wanted a way for both tourists and locals to surface those moments and make exploring feel more like a shared story than a checklist.

## What it does

Local Gems is a map-based feed of photos and notes pinned to specific places. Users explore gems within a chosen radius, open pins to see what was shared, appraise favorites, and post their own gem at their current location. The result is a lightweight way to discover new corners of a city and leave something behind for the next person.
